# Lung Cancer Detection & Risk Scoring System — Documentation

These pages describe how users will interact with our senior design system that analyzes **CT scans** to:
- preprocess lung CT data,
- detect suspicious nodules,
- (future) segment nodules,
- (future) estimate malignancy risk / map to Lung-RADS-style categories,
- generate a patient-level summary report.

> Status note: This documentation reflects the **planned MVP** and intended workflow.  
> Some features are under development and described as **“Planned”**.

## Intended Audience
- Demo users (students/instructors) who want to run the pipeline on sample CT data
- Technical evaluators who want to understand inputs/outputs and limitations
